    pureSalsa20.py -- a pure Python implementation of the Salsa20 cipher
    ====================================================================
    There are comments here by two authors about three pieces of software:
        comments by Larry Bugbee about
            Salsa20, the stream cipher by Daniel J. Bernstein
                 (including comments about the speed of the C version) and
            pySalsa20, Bugbee's own Python wrapper for salsa20.c
                 (including some references), and
        comments by Steve Witham about
            pureSalsa20, Witham's pure Python 2.5 implementation of Salsa20,
                which follows pySalsa20's API, and is in this file.

    Salsa20: a Fast Streaming Cipher (comments by Larry Bugbee)
    -----------------------------------------------------------

    Salsa20 is a fast stream cipher written by Daniel Bernstein
    that basically uses a hash function and XOR making for fast
    encryption.  (Decryption uses the same function.)  Salsa20
    is simple and quick.

    Some Salsa20 parameter values...
        design strength    128 bits
        key length         128 or 256 bits, exactly
        IV, aka nonce      64 bits, always
        chunk size         must be in multiples of 64 bytes

    Salsa20 has two reduced versions, 8 and 12 rounds each.

    One benchmark (10 MB):
        1.5GHz PPC G4     102/97/89 MB/sec for 8/12/20 rounds
        AMD Athlon 2500+   77/67/53 MB/sec for 8/12/20 rounds
          (no I/O and before Python GC kicks in)

    Salsa20 is a Phase 3 finalist in the EU eSTREAM competition
    and appears to be one of the fastest ciphers.  It is well
    documented so I will not attempt any injustice here.  Please
    see "References" below.

    ...and Salsa20 is "free for any use".


    pySalsa20: a Python wrapper for Salsa20 (Comments by Larry Bugbee)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    pySalsa20.py is a simple ctypes Python wrapper.  Salsa20 is
    as it's name implies, 20 rounds, but there are two reduced
    versions, 8 and 12 rounds each.  Because the APIs are
    identical, pySalsa20 is capable of wrapping all three
    versions (number of rounds hardcoded), including a special
    version that allows you to set the number of rounds with a
    set_rounds() function.  Compile the version of your choice
    as a shared library (not as a Python extension), name and
    install it as libsalsa20.so.

    Sample usage:
        from pySalsa20 import Salsa20
        s20 = Salsa20(key, IV)
        dataout = s20.encryptBytes(datain)   # same for decrypt

    This is EXPERIMENTAL software and intended for educational
    purposes only.  To make experimentation less cumbersome,
    pySalsa20 is also free for any use.

    Prerequisites for pySalsa20:
    ----------------------------
      - Python 2.5 (haven't tested in 2.4)


    pureSalsa20: Salsa20 in pure Python 2.5 (comments by Steve Witham)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    pureSalsa20 is the stand-alone Python code in this file.
    It implements the underlying Salsa20 core algorithm
    and emulates pySalsa20's Salsa20 class API (minus a bug(*)).

    pureSalsa20 is MUCH slower than libsalsa20.so wrapped with pySalsa20--
    about 1/1000 the speed for Salsa20/20 and 1/500 the speed for Salsa20/8,
    when encrypting 64k-byte blocks on my computer.

    pureSalsa20 is for cases where portability is much more important than
    speed.  I wrote it for use in a "structured" random number generator.

    There are comments about the reasons for this slowness in
          http://www.tiac.net/~sw/2010/02/PureSalsa20

    Sample usage:
        from pureSalsa20 import Salsa20
        s20 = Salsa20(key, IV)
        dataout = s20.encryptBytes(datain)   # same for decrypt

    I took the test code from pySalsa20, added a bunch of tests including
    rough speed tests, and moved them into the file testSalsa20.py.
    To test both pySalsa20 and pureSalsa20, type
        python testSalsa20.py

    (*)The bug (?) in pySalsa20 is this.  The rounds variable is global to the
    libsalsa20.so library and not switched when switching between instances
    of the Salsa20 class.
        s1 = Salsa20( key, IV, 20 )
        s2 = Salsa20( key, IV, 8 )
    In this example,
        with pySalsa20, both s1 and s2 will do 8 rounds of encryption.
        with pureSalsa20, s1 will do 20 rounds and s2 will do 8 rounds.
    Perhaps giving each instance its own nRounds variable, which
    is passed to the salsa20wordtobyte() function, is insecure.  I'm not a
    cryptographer.

    pureSalsa20.py and testSalsa20.py are EXPERIMENTAL software and
    intended for educational purposes only.  To make experimentation less
    cumbersome, pureSalsa20.py and testSalsa20.py are free for any use.

    Revisions:
    ----------
      p3.2   Fixed bug that initialized the output buffer with plaintext!
             Saner ramping of nreps in speed test.
             Minor changes and print statements.
      p3.1   Took timing variability out of add32() and rot32().
             Made the internals more like pySalsa20/libsalsa .
             Put the semicolons back in the main loop!
             In encryptBytes(), modify a byte array instead of appending.
             Fixed speed calculation bug.
             Used subclasses instead of patches in testSalsa20.py .
             Added 64k-byte messages to speed test to be fair to pySalsa20.
      p3     First version, intended to parallel pySalsa20 version 3.
